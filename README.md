### **Motivation**
Requirement Summary:

•	Perform PEST framework analysis to identify key business problems affecting car price valuation on Gumtree.

•	Translate the business problem into a machine learning problem.

•	Apply and compare different machine learning techniques, such as Linear Regression, Clustering, and Random Forest Regression.

•	Conduct data pre-processing, including feature selection, scaling, and handling missing values.

•	Develop and evaluate the performance of various machine learning models.

### **Summary of the code**

•	All data processing, analysis, and model development were conducted using Python.

•	Key libraries used include Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

•	Regression analysis and clustering models were employed to predict car prices and classify car listings into meaningful clusters.

•	Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, standardizing numerical features, and converting categorical variables into dummy variables.

•	The models were trained using an 80/20 train-test split, and various evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared were used to assess model performance.

### **Summary of Results (from the report)**

•	Adjusted R-squared for Random Forest Regression: 0.93

•	The analysis revealed that Random Forest Regression outperformed Logistic Regression and other models in predicting car prices with high accuracy.

•	Clustering analysis successfully categorized car listings into distinct segments based on key features, aiding in more accurate price recommendations.

•	It is recommended that Gumtree implement these machine learning models to enhance its pricing strategies, which could lead to higher user satisfaction, increased transaction success rates, and competitive market positioning.

•	Regular retraining of the models with updated data is suggested to maintain their effectiveness.
